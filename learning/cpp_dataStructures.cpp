// This file goes over creating new data structures, including nested
// data structures, how to access its members and how to pass them as
// function arguments
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <sstream> // stringstream()
using namespace std;

/*
To create a new data structure, use
	struct dStructureName {
		member1Type member1Name;
		member2Type member2Name;
		member3Type member3Name;
		...
	}

Pointers can also point to data structures. Given a pointer `myPointer`
which points to an object `objectA` of a data structure `myDStructure`,
use the usual syntax to create the pointer, except the data type will be
the data structure:
	myDStrucutre * myPointer;
	myPointer = &objectA;
Then, for the pointer to access the members of the object, the arrow (`->`)
operator is used. If `myDStructure` has a `year` member, it can be accessed
by the pointer as:
	myPointer -> year = 2019;
	(which is the same as `(*myPointer).year = 2019;` )
The arrow operator is a dereference operator to access the members of an
object a pointer points to.
